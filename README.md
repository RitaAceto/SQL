**Rita Aceto's SQL Portfolio**

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This code repository was created to store examples of SQL I've written during my training. This space will be updated with every new SQLs I write during my training and afterwards. Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions: ritaaceto@icloud.com.
